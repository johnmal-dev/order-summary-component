## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- PureRef Images App
- Less CSS

### What I learned
- How to use Less CSS media queries
```css
.text {
  ...
  padding: 1.6rem;
  @media (min-width: 768px) {
    padding: 3rem;
  }
  ...
}
```

### Useful resources

- [PureRef](https://www.pureref.com/) - This helped me compare my work to the provided example images. I really liked this app and will use it going forward.
- [Less CSS](https://lesscss.org/) - Less (which stands for Leaner Style Sheets) is a backwards-compatible language extension for CSS. This made for a quicker, cleaner CSS coding experience.
- [Koala App](http://koala-app.com/) - Koala is a GUI application for Less (and other preprocessors!) that automatically converts my .less files to .css files.
